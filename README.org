#+TITLE: piano-mode

Piano-Mode is a minor mode for Emacs that turns your keyboard into a "piano" keyboard. It is modeled after the behavior of music trackers or digital audio workstations.

Since (to the best of my knowledge) Emacs does not provide any way to differentiate between a user's keystrokes and OS-generated key repeat events, and doesn't expose key release events to Elisp at all, this mode uses the time between events to determine whether a key is still "pressed". Obviously, this is hackish, so expect glitchy behavior to occur sometimes. You may also want to tune the ~piano-key-repeat-delay~ and ~piano-key-repeat-rate~ variables to be based on your OS settings.

Additionally, this will obviously only work if you're using a QWERTY keyboard layout.
